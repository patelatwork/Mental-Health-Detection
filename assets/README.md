# Assets Folder

This folder contains static assets for the application.

## Contents

- `logo.png` - Application logo (optional, for sidebar)
- Other images and icons as needed

## Adding a Logo

To add a logo:
1. Place your logo image file in this folder
2. Name it `logo.png` (or update the reference in `app.py`)
3. Recommended size: 200px width
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG

## Note

The application will work without a logo. If no logo is found, the app will simply display the text header instead.
